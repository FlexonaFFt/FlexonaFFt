<p align="justify">
    My name is Igor, and I am a student of the Faculty of Computer Science at the Don State Technical University, specializing in machine learning. It is not just about being a programmer; the idea is to become a person who sincerely loves one's work and seeks continuous development in this sphere.
    I would love to work with new materials and technologies, studying them actively. Besides general training, I am especially interested in the development of Web 3. What lures me is its novelty and great perspectives for creating completely new solutions. I try to deepen my knowledge and skills in this sphere by means of participation in various projects and initiatives concerning Web development.
